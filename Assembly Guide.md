## **Test the main PCBs before soldering**

All PCBs are tested prior shipping, but it’s a good practice to make sure it’s working before soldering. It should be recognised as keyboard when plugged, test it by shorting switch pins with tweezers. Don’t panic if the right side PCB outputted wrong keys, as the firmware is set to left as master. I.e. USB cable should be connected to left halve when in use.



## **Assembling the Main PCBs**

_Blue = In-switch LEDs_

_Orange = Panel LEDs_

There’re 33 in-switch and 6 for panel LEDs on the left half. 37 in-switch (38 for split backspace) and 6 panel LEDs on the right side.


## **Panel LEDs**

To solder side panel LED, LED lens should be faced up. Align the marking on the PCB and the LED, repeat the same process to the rest.
